## Objective


This lab demonstrates how to install and configure Active Directory using Azure. I used two virtual machines on Azure that are on the same virtual network. One VM I installed Active Directory and configured it to be the Domain Controller and the other VM I used as a client. Then, I configured the Active Directory to allow the client to join the domain as well as creating user accounts using a Powershell script. This Active Directoy Lab project aimed to establish a controlled environment for simulating, troubleshooting,  both System Administrator and I.T. helpdesk functionality. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.
